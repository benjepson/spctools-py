# spctools

Python package for Statistical Process Control (SPC) functionality.

This package will provide functions to support real world SPC workflows. SPC calculations involve several steps, and it is important to document the process. This package will be opinionated, based on my experiences as an industrial scientist and statistician using SPC.
